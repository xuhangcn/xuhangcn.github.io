About Me
======
I received my Bachelor's degree in Statistics at Fudan University in 2013. 
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at Hong Kong University (HKU) in 2018, supervised by Prof. Philip L H Yu. During PhD study, I was also a research assistant at the University of Ottawa, supervised by Prof. Mayer Alvo from 2016 to 2018. After graduation, I joined Huawei Noah's Ark Lab in 2018. 

Currently, I am a **Senior Researcher** at the Computer Vision Lab in **Huawei Noah's Ark Lab**. I am leading a research team in Shanghai. We are focusing on industrial research in deep learning and high-level recognition machine learning technics in computer vision in Huawei.

Research Interest
======
Recently, my research interest includes:
1. High-level Recognition Models including 2D/3D Object Detection, Segmentation, Lane detection in Autonomous Driving.
2. Multi-modality Learning, such as image-text pretrained models, large-scale pretrained models, Lidar/Camera perception models.
3. Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML),  specially on NAS and HPO.

<!-- About Me
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section -->
